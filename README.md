# Mudlet Muddler LuaRocks Starter

An experimental starter template for building [Mudlet](https://www.mudlet.org/) 
packages using [muddler](https://github.com/demonnic/muddler), [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/), and [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.1).

Mudlet is a free, open-source, cross-platform client for playing and scripting 
MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons).

## Features

- Project scaffolding for new Mudlet packages
- Ready-to-use [muddler](https://github.com/demonnic/muddler) build configuration
- [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/) support for dependency management
- GitHub Actions CI for automated testing and packaging, including dev snapshots
  and tagged releases.  
  [See CI workflow summary below.](#continuous-integration)
- Package-level environment isolation: each package runs in its own Lua 
  environment, keeping globals and event handlers separate from other packages
  and Mudlet itself, and enabling isolated initialization of your app code.  
  [See package isolation details.](docs/package-isolation.md)

> **Note:**  
> This starter is intended for experimental, proof-of-concept applications that
> want to go beyond the boundaries of Mudlet's graphical scripting interface.

> **LuaRocks note:**  
> This template is designed for pure-Lua dependencies only. It does not include 
> or support OS-specific binaries or compiled modules. Please ensure that all 
> dependencies specified in your production `.rockspec` are pure Lua. If you add
> native modules, they may not work across platforms or with Mudlet.

## Requirements

- [Mudlet](https://www.mudlet.org/) (client, for package testing)
- [muddler](https://github.com/demonnic/muddler) (for packaging)
- [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/) (for managing Lua dependencies)
- [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.1)
- [luaver](https://github.com/dhavalkapil/luaver) is recommended for managing multiple Lua versions,
  especially if you work with Lua 5.1 alongside other versions

> **Note:**  
> At the time of writing, Mudlet embeds and executes Lua 5.1 as its scripting
> environment. Thus all code and dependencies in this template must be
> compatible with Lua 5.1.

## Caveats

- **Pragmatic package isolation:**  
  While this template provides strong environment isolation for your package 
  code and event handlers, Mudlet’s Lua environment is still global at its core.
  Packages that intentionally bypass the isolation mechanisms (e.g., by writing 
  directly to `_G`) can escape and interfere with each other.
- **Module name collisions:**  
  In standard Mudlet scripting, modules are cached globally by name. With this
  template, your package’s custom `require` ensures modules are namespaced and 
  isolated, while remaining transparently cached. However, use of the global 
  `require` can still cause conflicts.
- **Pure-Lua dependencies only:**  
  Only pure-Lua LuaRocks modules are supported. Packaging of native (binary)
  modules is not supported and may not work reliably.
- **Shared base environment:**  
  All packages inherit from Mudlet’s global environment. This means global 
  variables and functions defined outside isolated environments remain visible
  unless explicitly hidden or shadowed.
- **No security sandbox:**  
  This isolation is pragmatic, not security-focused. Malicious or buggy code 
  can still affect the entire Mudlet session if it deliberately escapes its
  environment.
- **Direct global access remains possible:**  
  Code can still assign to or read from `_G` directly if it chooses, bypassing 
  the isolation. Use care when integrating with legacy scripts or third-party
  packages.
- **Event handler isolation relies on registration:**  
  Only event handlers registered from within the isolated environment are 
  wrapped. Handlers registered globally or from outside the package context may 
  not be isolated.

## Getting Started

1. **Use this template:**
   Click "Use this template" on GitHub, download the source archive, or clone 
   and remove `.git` to start a new project without inheriting git history:
   ```
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/toasted-mudlet/mudlet-muddler-luarocks-starter.git
   rm -rf .git
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit from mudlet-muddler-luarocks-starter"
   ```
2. **Install [muddler](https://github.com/demonnic/muddler), [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/)** and
   [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.1)
3. **Customize the template:**  
   Replace placeholder files and metadata with your own package content.  
   [See template customization guide.](docs/template-customization.md)
4. **Build your package:**  
   Use muddler to build your package.  
   [See local development environment details.](docs/local-dev-env.md)

> **Note:** This is a project scaffolding template. No product-specific code or
> features are included.

## Continuous Integration

This repository uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and packaging:

- **Dev Snapshot:**  
  Builds and tests a development snapshot on every push or pull request to
  `main`, and on manual trigger. Uploads the package as an artifact.
- **Manual Release:**  
  Manually triggered release that builds, tests, tags, and publishes a new
  versioned package and GitHub Release.
- **Tag Release:**  
  Automatically builds, tests, and publishes a release package and GitHub
  Release whenever a new version tag is pushed.
